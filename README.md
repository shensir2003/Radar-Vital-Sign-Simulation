# Radar Vital Sign Simulation

A Python-based simulation of radar signals for respiration and heartbeat detection, including motion artifact analysis and filtering implementations.  
**Developed for academic research purposes.**

## Features
- 📡 Synthetic radar signal generation with adjustable parameters (respiration, heartbeat, motion noise)
- 📊 FFT-based frequency analysis
- 🛠️ Multiple filtering methods:
  - Moving Average Filter
  - Butterworth Bandpass Filter (0.1-2Hz)
- 📈 Visualization of raw/filtered signals and spectrum comparison
